Here we present the first data release of the \kepler Smear Campaign, using collateral `smear' data obtained by \kepler to reconstruct light curves of 102~stars too bright to have been otherwise targeted. We describe the pipeline developed to extract and calibrate these light curves, and show that we attain photometric precision comparable to stars analyzed by the standard pipeline in the nominal \kepler mission.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

% The \kepler Space Telescope, operated by NASA, was launched in 2009 to obtain photometry of hundreds of thousands of stars in a field in Cygnus-Lyra, in order to detect a statistically-useful sample of transiting exoplanets \citep{2010Sci...327..977B}. It achieved this primary goal, showing that exoplanets are common around Sun-like stars \citep{2013ApJ...766...81F,2013PNAS..11019273P,2014ApJ...795...64F}, though with the failure of two reaction wheels, the mission was cut short and there remain substantial uncertainties on these estimates. \kepler was revived as a two-wheeled mission, K2, with its third axis balanced against solar radiation pressure. K2 is therefore constrained to point in the ecliptic plane, which it surveys in a succession of $\sim 80$~day Campaigns. In this paper, we will deal exclusively with data from the nominal \kepler mission before this change.

% Beyond searching for planets, 
\kepler has revolutionized the field of asteroseismology for solar-like oscillations \citep{2010PASP..122..131G,2010ApJ...713L.169C}. It has yielded the detection of gravity-mode period spacings in a red giant \citep{rggmodes,2014A&A...572L...5M}, enabling probes of interior rotation of red giants \citep{rggmoderotation,2012A&A...548A..10M} and distinguishing between hydrogen- and helium-burning cores \citep{rggmodehelium,2012A&A...540A.143M}. It has also permitted the determination of ages and fundamental parameters of main-sequence stars as cool as the Sun and hotter \citep{silvaages}, including planet-hosting stars \citep{huberplanetages,silvaplanetages,2018MNRAS.479.4786V}, revealing the most ancient known planetary system, dating back to the earliest stages of the galaxy \citep{ancientplanets}. %By comparing asteroseismic stellar ages to stellar rotation periods, \citet{angusgyro} have shown that gyrochronology models cannot fit the data with a single relation, leading~\citet{vansadersgyro}~to suggest a qualitative change in dynamo mechanism as stars age through the main sequence. 
\newpage

A major outcome of the \kepler asteroseismology programme is a legacy sample of extremely well characterized stars that can serve as benchmarks for future work \citep{keplerlegacy1,keplerlegacy2}. Asteroseismological studies with \kepler complement other probes of stellar physics well: for example, the APOKASC sample of~1916 spectroscopically- and asteroseismically-characterized red giant stars \citep{2014ApJS..215...19P}. For this APOKASC sample, \citet{hawkinsapogee} have been able to extract precise elemental abundances by fitting spectroscopic data with \logg and \teff fixed to asteroseismically-determined values. It is necessary to calibrate such a study against benchmark stars with very precisely-determined parameters, which in practice requires nearby bright stars that are amenable to very high signal-to-noise spectroscopy plus asteroseismology \citep{creeveybenchmark}, parallaxes \citep{hawkinsbenchmarks}, and/or interferometry \citep{casagrandebenchmark,creeveybenchmark2}. This is especially important in the context of the \gaia mission \citep{gaia}, which has recently put out its second data release of 1,692,919,135 sources, including 1,331,909,727 with parallaxes \citep{gaiadr2}. These data will form the basis of many large surveys and it is vital that they are calibrated correctly. To this end, 34~FGK stars including both giants and dwarfs have been chosen as \gaia-ESO benchmark stars for which metallicities \citep{gaiabenchmark1}, effective temperatures and asteroseismic surface gravities \citep{gaiabenchmark3}, and relative abundances of $\alpha$ and iron-peak elements \citep{gaiabenchmark4} have been determined. This includes only four main sequence stars much cooler than the Sun, due to the paucity of such stars with asteroseismology. This has been accompanied by the release of high resolution spectra \citep{gaiabenchmark2} and formed the basis of extensions to lower metallicities \citep{gaiabenchmark5}, stellar twin studies \citep{gaiabenchmarktwins} and comparisons of stellar abundance determination pipelines \citep{gaiabenchmarkabundances}. Furthermore, by combining asteroseismology with optical interferometry, it has been possible to determine fundamental parameters of main-sequence and giant stars with unprecedented precision \citep{huber12,thetacygwhite,white15}. 

Brighter \kepler stars are therefore ideal benchmark targets, since photometry can be most easily complemented by \gaia parallaxes, interferometric diameters, and high resolution spectroscopy.  
Unfortunately, the \kepler field was deliberately placed to minimize overall the number of extremely bright stars on the detectors, so that only a dozen stars brighter than~6th~magnitude landed on silicon \citep{2010ApJ...713L..79K}. This was because stars brighter than $Kp \sim 11$ saturate the CCD detectors, with their flux distributed along a bleed column and rendering those pixels otherwise unusable. Furthermore, due to the limited availablility of bandwidth to download data from the spacecraft, only $\sim 5.7\%$ of pixels on the \kepler detectors are actually downloaded in any one Quarter \citep{2010ApJ...713L..87J}. The result of these two target selection constraints is that photometry was obtained for most of the mission for only~35 stars brighter than $Kp<7$ in the \kepler field, while~17 targets in this range were observed for less than half the mission and~29 targets brighter than this threshold were entirely ignored. The availability of \kepler data remains significantly incomplete down to fainter magnitudes, and in this work we consider $Kp=9$ to be an arbitrary cutoff for bright stars of interest. In the \ktwo mission \citep{k2early}, very saturated stars have been observed with `halo photometry' using unsaturated pixels in a specially-determined region around bright stars, including the Pleiades \citep{halo}, Aldebaran \citep{aldebaran}, and $\rho$~Leonis \citep{rholeo}. Unfortunately, in the legacy \kepler sample, photometry of such saturated stars was rarely attempted.

\citet{orig_smear} noted a way to obtain photometry of every target on-silicon in \kepler using a data channel normally used for calibration, even if active pixels were not allocated and downloaded. \kepler employs an inter-line transfer CCD as its detector, which successively shuffles each row of pixels down to the edges of the chip to be read out. Because the \kepler camera lacks a shutter, the detector is exposed to light during the readout process, with the result that fluxes in each pixel are contaminated by light collected from stars in the same column. This is a particularly serious issue for faint stars in the same detector column as brighter stars, and it is important to calibrate this at each readout stage. Six rows of blank `masked' pixels were allocated in each column to measure the smear bias; furthermore, six `virtual' rows were recorded at the end of the readout, with the result that twelve rows of pixels sample the smear bias in each column. \citet{orig_smear} realized that these encode the light curves of bright targets in a 1D projection of the star field. The masked and virtual smear registers each receive $\sim 1/1034$ of the incident flux in each column. If this is dominated by the light from a single star, the flux combining both smear registers is equivalent to that of a star $\sim 6.8$~times fainter. 

In \citet{smear}, we demonstrated a method for extracting precise light curves of bright stars in \kepler and \ktwo from these collateral data, and presented light curves of a small number of variable stars as examples to illustrate this method. In this paper we present smear light curves of all unobserved or significantly under-observed stars brighter than $Kp=9$ in the \kepler field. This sample mostly consists of red giants and hot stars, containing only one~G dwarf. We find no transiting planets, but detect one new eclipsing binary, and measure solar-like oscillations in 34~red giants. We do not model main sequence stars in great detail, but provide some discussion and initial classification of interesting variability. For the oscillating red giants that constitute the bulk of the sample, we determine the asteroseismic parameters \numax and \Dnu, and therefore stellar masses and \logg measurements. We have also obtained high-resolution optical spectroscopy of 63~stars, predominantly giants, with the Tillinghast Reflector \'{E}chelle Spectrograph (TRES). For the~34 stars with both spectroscopy and asteroseismic parameters we derive fundamental stellar parameters and elemental abundances. These asteroseismic constraints can be compared to those from \gaia, offering the opportunity both to test asteroseismic scaling relations and combine both datasets to refine the benchmark star properties further.

We have made all new data products and software discussed in this paper publicly available, and encourage interested readers to use these in their own research.   

\section{Method}
\label{method}

We have obtained smear light curves for our sample of red giant stars with the \texttt{keplersmear} pipeline as described in Section~\ref{photometry}, performed asteroseismology on all of these to extract \numax and therefore \logg as described in Section~\ref{asteroseismology}, and combined these with TRES spectra to obtain chemical abundances as described in Section~\ref{spectroscopy}. 

\subsection{Sample}
\label{sample}

We selected as our sample all stars on-silicon in \kepler with $Kp<9$ that were targeted for fewer than an arbitrary $8$ quarters, the majority of which were previously entirely missing. Sixteen stars were to some extent observed conventionally: HD~174020 was targeted in LC for Q2, 6, 10, and 14; HD~175841 for Q11-12, 14-16, with SC for Q3; HD~176582 for Q12-13; HD~178090 for Q1, 3, and 10; HD~180682 for Q0, 3, and 7; HD~181069 for Q1, 10, 13, 14, and 17; HD~181878 for Q14-17; HD~182694 for Q2; HD~183124 for even quarters; HD~185351 for Q1-3 and with SC for Q16; HD~186155 for only Q1; HD~187217 for Q14-17; HD~188252 for only Q13; HD~189013 with SC for Q3 as a $\gamma$~Dor; V380~Cyg for Q11 and with SC for Q7, 9, 10, 12-17; and V819~Cyg for Q14, 16 and 17. A number of these lay at the edge of a detector, with the result that in some cadences the centroid of the star did not lie on the chip; light curves from these targets were found to be of extremely low quality and all of these stars were discarded. After applying these criteria we obtained a list of 102 targets, which are listed in Table~\ref{all_stars} with their \kepler magnitude $Kp$ together with their spectral type from SIMBAD, \gaia~DR2 apparent~$G$ magnitudes and $Bp-Rp$ colours, \gaia~DR2 calibrated distances from \citet{gaiadists}, variability classification and availability of TRES spectroscopy. The \kepler spacecraft rotates between quarters, so that it cycles through four orientation `seasons' each rotated from the last by $90^{\circ}$. Some stars did not land on silicon for all seasons: we have only one season of HD~179394; two for HD~187277, HD~226754, V554~Lyr, and BD+47~2891; and three for BD+43~3064. The addition of our sample to the conventionally-observed stars makes the \kepler survey magnitude-complete down to $Kp=9$ for all stars on-silicon.

Figure~\ref{hrdiagram} shows these stars on a colour-magnitude diagram using \gaia $Bp-Rp$ and absolute~$G$ magnitudes and \gaia~DR2 calibrated distances \citep{gaiadists}, overlaid on the \kepler sample from the Bedell \url{gaia-kepler.fun} crossmatch. The smear targets in this diagram appear to have not merely higher apparent brightnesses than the general \kepler population, but also higher intrinsic luminosities. While this could simply arise from being selected for their apparent brightness, it is {}worth considering whether this is because of a bias in their parallax measurements. While \gaia parallaxes for very bright stars can be subject to systematic error, we have compared these to those found by \emph{Hipparcos} \citep{vanleeuwen07b}, and found close agreement for the brightest stars, with a scatter that increases with magnitude. We therefore suggest that parallax bias is not the reason for the smear sample sitting above the remainder of the \kepler sample.

We identify the evolutionary state of stars in the main sequence versus evolved stars first from the \gaia colour-magnitude diagram in Figure~\ref{hrdiagram}. Taking a cutoff in \gaia $Bp-Rp > 1$, we identify 66 of these stars as evolved systems, and the remaining~36 lie apparently on the main sequence. 

The coolest main sequence star, BD+43~3068, is a G0 dwarf with a $G$ magnitude of 8.3 and a distance of $53.8 \pm 0.1$~pc, and it is therefore surprising that it was not included in the nominal \kepler survey as a solar analogue. It is possible that it was previously misidentified as a giant. Regrettably, it is only possible to reconstruct a light curve with the 30~minute long cadence and therefore it is not possible to do asteroseismology on this bright, nearby solar-like star. Its light curve shows neither rotational modulation (as determined by its featureless autocorrelation) nor evidence for transits.

Considering stars lying close to the main sequence, from the \kepler power spectrum we identify solar-like oscillations in HD~182354 and HD~176209 at frequencies consistent with them being subgiants or contaminated with flux from red giants. \textcolor{red}{Get frequencies}.

\subsection{Photometry}
\label{photometry}

In preparing light curves of the \kepler smear stars, we have followed the methods described in \citet{smear}, with some improvements. We selected our input RA and Dec values from the \kepler Input Catalog (KIC) \citep{kic}, and queried MAST to find the corresponding mean pixel position for a given \kepler quarter. We then measured the centroid of smear columns in the vicinity, and used these values to do raw aperture photometry. We found that the cosine-bell aperture used for raw photometry in \citet{smear} can in some light curves introduce position-dependent systematics and jumps. We instead in this work have applied a super-Gaussian aperture, $A \propto \exp{\dfrac{-(x-x_0)}{w} ^ 4}$, where $x_0$ is the centroid and $w$ a width in pixels. The very flat top of this function helps avoid significant variation with position, while still smoothly rolling off at the edges to avoid discontinuous artefacts. This is calculated on a grid of $10\,\times$ subsampled points in pixel space so that the sharply varying edge changes column weights smoothly as a function of centroid. We have then extracted photometry using apertures with a range of widths $w \in\{1.5,~2,~3,~4,~5\}$ pixels.

From this raw photometry a background light curve was subtracted, which corrects for time-varying global systematics. Whereas in \citet{smear} we subtracted a background estimate chosen manually, for this larger set of light curves, we have now chosen the lowest $25\%$ of pixels by median flux as being unlikely to be contaminated by stars, and taken our background level to be the median of this at each time sample. To denoise this, we fit a Gaussian Process with a 30-day timescale squared exponential kernel using \textsc{george} \citep{hodlr}, and our final background light curve is taken to be the posterior mean of this GP. 

The dominant source of residual systematic errors in nominal \kepler time series is a common-mode variation primarily due to thermal changes on board the spacecraft, an issue which is traditionally dealt with by identifying and fitting a linear combination of systematic modes \citep{pdc0,pdc1,pdc2,petigura}. We have adopted the same approach here, using the \kepler Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) Cotrending Basis Vectors (CBVs) available from MAST, finding least-squares fits of either the first~4 or~8 CBVs to each light curve. This can subtract astrophysical signals on long timescales, such that we use and recommend 4~CBV light curves for stars with variability on timescales longer than $\sim 5$ days, or indeed raw uncorrected lightcurves for stars variable at high amplitude on $\sim$~quarter timescales, but otherwise we recommend the 8~CBV light curves. There is some room for improvement here by simultaneously modelling astrophysical and instrumental variations, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. In the following, we will use the light curves with the lowest 6.5~hr Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP) \citep{cdpp} out of all apertures, as calculated with the \textsc{k2sc} implementation \citep{k2sc}. This is not necessarily the optimal choice for all red giants, especially those with oscillations on a 6.5~h timescale, but is a reasonable proxy nevertheless for white noise and leads to satisfactory results upon visual inspection of the present sample.

% \end{figure}

Because the smear data are collected along an entire CCD~column, there is the risk of contamination from other bright stars. This is especially true in doing asteroseismology of red giants, where the low-amplitude stochastically-excited oscillations can be washed out in a power spectrum by the coherent high amplitude variations of a classical pulsator, even if the background star is much fainter. We can assess the importance of this contamination by considering the differences between odd and even quarters: because the \kepler spacecraft rotates $90^{\circ}$ between successive quarters, any contaminant will lie in the same column as a smear target only every second quarter, falling in the other quarters in the same row but not necessarily the same column. We have therefore generated Lomb-Scargle periodograms \citep{lomb,scargle} of each light curve, clipped for outliers, and considering only odd and even quarters, and both visually inspected these for significant differences. In the great majority of cases they closely resemble one another, indicating that contamination is at worst a minor effect. In order to better quantify this, we compute the inner product of  normalized periodograms of the odd and even quarters each smoothed with a 3-element Gaussian kernel. If this overlap integral is 1, then the power spectra are identical; substantial departures from unity may be caused by real nonstationary or long-period stellar variation, noise, or gain or contamination differences between the seasons. We find that the distribution of overlaps is strongly peaked around $\sim 0.91$, with a tail of 22 stars showing overlap $< 0.9$. We investigate these further, finding that in not all of these cases is there an obvious problem, for example the classical pulsator HD~175841 in which amplitudes of several pulsations have changed but the overall distribution seems very similar, in which we conclude that the variation is probably astrophysical or an artefact of our data processing. 

In the case of HD~181878, a red giant, there is clear and significant contamination from an M~giant, as is seen in Figure~\ref{contamination}. Likewise HD~183383 shows two different stars, depending on the quarter: some parts are likely from an ellipsoidal variable with a period of 6.46 days, other parts are from an RR Lyrae pulsator. Between seasons, there is an extra hump of power near the red giant oscillations in HD~175740; extra low frequency power in HD~180658; one coherent peak in  HD~182694; high frequency contamination in HD~181597 possibly from an EB; and a very significant difference in amplitude between seasons for BD~+39~3882. In other cases visual inspection does not show severe contamination, but in all cases we recommend that users of these light curves carefully check for differences between odd and even quarters.

\subsection{Asteroseismology}
\label{asteroseismology}

Among the~66 red giants identified in this sample, for~32 the timescale of their variability is of the same order as a \kepler quarter and they are thus badly affected by systematics and systematics correction. In Table~\ref{all_stars} we have noted these as `long-period variables' (LPVs), without specifically meaning these are LPVs by a particular astrophysical definition, and they are discussed further in Section~\ref{lpvs}. For the~34 giants for which there is high-SNR shorter-timescale variability, we have attempted to extract the asteroseismic parameters \numax and $\langle \Dnu \rangle$ \citep{KB95,2013ARA&A..51..353C}. These constrain fundamental stellar parameters through the approximate scaling relations: 

\begin{equation}
\label{scaling}
\numax \propto \dfrac{g}{g_{\sun}} \cdot \left(\dfrac{\teff}{\teff_{\sun}}\right)^{\dfrac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\langle \Dnu \rangle \propto \sqrt{\langle \rho \rangle} = \sqrt{M {R}^{-3}}
\end{equation}

We have followed the method of \citet{2016AN....337..774D}, obtaining a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the smoothed time series according to the method of \citet{2011MNRAS.414L...6G}. The posterior distribution of the asteroseismic parameters is obtained with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to the smoothed periodogram, applying the combined granulation and oscillation model of \citet{2014A&A...570A..41K}. This consists of two Harvey profiles for the granulation \citep{1985ESASP.235..199H}, a Gaussian envelope for the stellar oscillations, and a white noise background for instrumental noise. The marginal posterior distribution for the oscillation envelope is well-approximated by a single Gaussian, and we have taken its median and standard deviation to be our estimates for \numax and its uncertainty.

To estimate \Dnu, we have divided the power spectrum through by the granulation and noise models to obtain a signal-to-noise spectrum, and fit a sum of Lorentzians separated by mean large (\Dnu) and small (\dnu) separations to the part of this spectrum in the vicinity of \numax. In practice, for this dataset, \dnu is not constrained, but mean $\langle \Dnu \rangle$ is typically well-constrained and its posterior marginal distribution is well-represented by a single Gaussian as with \numax. 

We obtain good estimates of these asteroseismic parameters for 34 targets, presented in Table~\ref{astero_table}. In the remainder of cases, as noted above, we find that the very-low-frequency ($\lesssim 2\muHz$) oscillations are affected by filter artefacts from detrending, and we are not able to obtain good estimates for these stars. 

Once \numax has been estimated, we have used Equation~\ref{scaling}, the asteroseismic scaling relation for \numax \citep{1991ApJ...368..599B,KB95}, to estimate \logg in order to inform extraction of chemical abundances from spectra. Using the initial spectroscopic estimate of \teff, which is not significantly informed by \numax, uncertainties in \numax are propagated with Monte Carlo sampling. 

For eight stars, we have found that the asteroseismic fit is unsatisfactory: for BD+39~388 we cannot detect the expected oscillations; for BD+43~3064 there are significant peaks but these are not consistent with the pattern expected from a red giant; for HD~179959 and HD~187217 we suspect contamination with the oscillations of a second giant, which is hard to remove from smear light curves; while for HD~188629, HD~188639 and HD~188875 we can extract a \numax but not a robust \Dnu. One star in our sample, HD~185351, has a mode envelope that is not well fit by our model. The smear light curve for this star has already been published by \citet{2017MNRAS.464.3713H}, who showed with detailed asteroseismic modelling that it had a zero-age main sequence mass of $\sim 1.60 \msun$ (a so-called `retired~A star') and used it to calibrate the convective overshoot parameter for low-luminosity red giants. The global asteroseismic modelling presented here should therefore be considered to be superseded by the more detailed model of \citet{2017MNRAS.464.3713H}.

\subsection{Spectroscopy}
\label{spectroscopy}

We have obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with TRES for~63 stars, mainly giants, in order to constrain stellar parameters and elemental abundances. Operating with spectral resolving power $R=44 000$, we have obtained spectra with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of tens to hundreds per resolution element. Although this resolution and SNR are sufficient for an exploratory study, for more detailed analysis it will be desirable to use APOGEE or similar instruments to obtain greater spectral coverage. From this observing run we have~34 unique targets with seismic \logg and spectra, one more star than the \gaia-ESO benchmark set and a significant addition to the ensemble of bright red giants with asteroseismic parameter determinations. Due to observing constraints, we were unable to obtain spectra for BD+42~3150, BD+48~2904, HD~176209, HD~182354, HD~189636AB, or HD~189750. % figure out this discrepancy?

To derive stellar parameters from our TRES spectra, we initially ran the Stellar Parameter Classification \citep[SPC:][]{spc} code to determine \teff and \logg, using the SPC \teff to inform the asteroseismic estimation of \logg from \numax. For deriving abundances, \teff is fixed from the results of an initial SPC fit, while \logg is fixed to the seismic values. The other stellar atmospheric parameters including the microturbulent velocity ($v_{\text{mic}}$), and broadening (convolution by $V_{\text{mac}}$, $v_{\sin{i}}$ and the instrumental line profile) as well as [Fe/H] and chemical abundances for 20 chemical species are derived using the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accUracy Spectra \citep[BACCHUS:][]{bacchus}, and the results from this calculation are displayed in Table~\ref{stellar_props}. BACCHUS uses an interpolation scheme through a grid of MARCS model atmospheres \citep{Gustafsson2008} in combination with TURBOSPECTRUM \citep{Alvarez1998, Plez2012}. For the calculation of synthetic spectra, atomic line information has been taken from the fifth version of the Gaia-ESO linelist (Heiter et al., in preparation). Additionally we used the molecular species for CH \citep{Masseron2014}, CN, NH, OH, MgH  C$_{2}$ (T. Masseron, private communication). The SiH molecular information is adopted from the Kurucz linelists and the information for TiO, ZrO, FeH, CaH from B. Plez (private communication). 

Individual elemental abundances are derived by first fixing the stellar atmospheric parameters to those determined above. Spectra are then synthesized  in regions centered around an absorption  feature of the element we want to derive. The spectra generated will have different [X/Fe] values. A $\chi^2$ minimization procedure is then done to derive the best fitting abundance for each line. The reported abundances are the median [X/Fe] value of the various line regions for a given element. Abundance uncertainties reported are the standard error in the line-by-line abundance ratios. Where only one line exists for a given element, we conservatively assume the standard error is 0.10~dex. In principle, these uncertainties are underestimated because there they do not include the errors driven by imperfect stellar parameter values and other systematic errors arising, for instance, from incorrect line list data. We do note, however, thus use of asteroseismology really reduces the uncertainties caused by the stellar parameters \citep[see][for a longer discussion on this]{hawkinsapogee}. 

To achieve the most precise abundances we have derived them using both with and without a line-by-line differential approach with respect to Arcturus ($\alpha$~Bo\"{o}tis) using the method described by \citet{gaiabenchmark4} and the Arcturus abundances from \citep{hawkinsapogee}. Choosing this method means we do not derive the abundances for neutron capture  elements (e.g. Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) in a differential way because there are no estimated values for these elements at the appropriate benchmark parameters of Arcturus. For these elements we instead derive the chemical abundances in an aboslute way where the solar abundances of \cite{Asplund2005} are assumed. The uncertainty in the abundances are taken a the line-by-line dispersion or assumed to be 0.10 when just one line is available. No abundances for oxygen could be reliably derived for any of the stars in our spectroscopic sample by either method.


{\bf Ben the tables should be remade to do Mg, Ti, Si, Ca, Al, V, Fe, Ni in on Table called differential abundances and second table of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu which is for the non-differential neutron capture} The results of these absolute abundance calculations {\bf without the line-by-line differential analysis implemented?}, are presented in Tables~\ref{elems1},~\ref{elems2} and~\ref{elems3}. Because for most  Arcturus differential abundances are not available, these are provided as supplementary online-only material.

\section{Results}
\label{targets}

\subsection{Red Giants}
\label{rgs}

We determined physical properties such as mass, radius, and age for the 33 red giants from their atmospheric and asteroseismic observables (see Table ) using the BAyesian STellar Algorithm \citep[\textsc{basta}][]{silvaaguirre2015,silvaaguirre2017}. \textsc{basta} compares the observed properties with predictions from theoretical models of stellar evolution, in this case the recently updated BaSTI (a Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones) stellar models and isochrones library \citep{Hidalgo:2018dy} with overshooting and no mass-loss.

The spectroscopic properties we fit are the effective temperature \teff, the metallicity \feh, and the surface gravities \logg from Table~\ref{stellar_props}. These are accompanied by the global asteroseismic properties \Dnu and \numax from Table~\ref{astero_table}. Theoretical predictions of \Dnu and \numax are computed using the asteroseismic scaling relation for any point along an evolutionary track or isochrone. For the solar values, we adopt $\nu_{\text{max, }\odot}=3090$~$\mu$Hz, $\Delta\nu_{\odot}=135.1$~$\mu$Hz \citep{huber2011}, and $T_{\text{eff, }\odot}=5777$~K.

The accuracy of the asteroseismic scaling relations across different metallicities, effective temperatures, and evolutionary status is currently an active discussion within the field of asteroseismology \citep[see][]{white2011,belkacem2011,sharma2016,viani2017}.
We apply the correction by \cite{Serenelli:2017cn} to the large frequency separation relation in Equation~\ref{Dnuscaling} as it has been shown to reproduce the results of a number of classical age determination for the open clusters M67 \citep{stello2016} and NGC~6819 \citep{casagrande2016}.

We compare the solutions found using this set of fitting parameter with those found using only spectroscopic input in Figure~\ref{masses}, and we find that the change in median stellar parameters between the two results is small for all analyzed red giants. However, in the comparison plot it becomes visible how adding the asteroseismic constraints to the fit narrows down the parameter space and thus decrease the derived uncertainties.

\end{figure*}



\subsubsection{Chemical Compositions}
\label{chemical}
The chemical composition for each star was measured in the $\alpha$ (Mg, Ti, Si, Ca), odd-Z (Al, V) and Fe-peak (Fe, Ni) elemental families in a differential way with respect to Arcturus. The chemical composition for the neutron capture elements are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ncap}, and are derived in absolute terms and not differentially with respect to Arcturus. The elemental abundance ratios were measured in order to assess the Galactic populations to which these stars belong. The first thing to note is that the metallicities, which are tabulated in Table~\ref{stellar_props}, are too high (with $-0.51<$~[M/H]~$<$ +0.14~dex) to belong to the Galactic halo, whose peak metallicity is around $\sim -1.50$ \cite[e.g.][]{Chiba2000}. Furthermore, the distance distribution, noted in Table~\ref{all_stars}, indicates that all stars are located within a few~kpc of the Sun and are not apart of the Galactic bulge. Thus, these stars are drawn from only the Galactic thick and thin disks. We provide a detailed chemical abundance analysis below to support this claim.\\

We also show a representative sample of Galactic disk stars from \citet[open red square,][]{Bensby2014}, \citet[open orange squares,][]{Adibekyan2012}, \citet[light green circles][]{Battistini2015}. These elemental ratios show that the chemical composition of our sample is consistent with the Galactic disk population. } %Mg was chosen as an illustrative $\alpha$-element. } 
\end{figure*}
One of the primary ways to determine, in a chemical sense, whether the stars in our sample are drawn from the Galactic disk(s), bulge or halo, is with the ratio of their $\alpha$-elements to Fe. The $\alpha$ elements are formed during He burning (e.g. Mg, Ti, Si, Ca) and largely dispersed into the interstellar medium through Type~II supernovae (SNII) \citep{Matteucci2001}. It has been shown by many studies \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{Edvardsson1993, Adibekyan2012, Feltzing2013, Bensby2014}, that the Galactic thick disk and thin disk separate in the $\alpha$ elements, where the thick disk is enhanced in [Mg, Si, Ca, Ti/Fe] compared to the Galactic thin disk at a given metallicity. In Fig.~\ref{alphael}, we display the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio as a function of [Fe/H] for our stars (black circles) compared\footnote{There may to be systematics between our [X/Fe] abundance scale and those of our comparison samples.} to representative thick and thin disk stars from \cite[open red square]{Bensby2014} and \cite[open orange triangles]{Adibekyan2012}. 

For most of the stars in our sample, the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced. This is true for all of the $\alpha$-elements except Ca where the is a much larger spread. The commonly used [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio, the average of Mg, Ti, Si, Ca (thus it is ([Mg/Fe] + [Ca/Fe] + [Si/Fe] + [Ti/Fe] / 4) ), is also enhanced in most stars. This is consistent with most of the stars observed here belonging to the Galactic disk with a slight (of order $\sim$0.15~dex) enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements. Fig.~\ref{alphael} clearly rule out the Galactic bulge (which would require the sample to be significantly more $\alpha$-enriched given their metallicity) and the Galactic halo (given that the stars would need to be significantly more metal-poor). %Though there are a handful of stars where the typical [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio is solar. 

In addition, to the $\alpha$ and odd-Z elements we also derived the chemical abundance for several neutron capture elements including Sr, Zr, La, Eu (left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:ncap}) as well as Y, Ba, and Nd (right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ncap}).  It is clear from Fig.~\ref{fig:ncap}  that the chemical abundance ratio of neutron each neutron capture element is consistent with the Galactic disk population. We do however observe that the Ba of our sample is slightly enhanced while the Y of our sample is slightly reduced relative to the general disk population of \cite{Bensby2014}. Nevertheless, we conclude all elemental abundance ratios studied our sample most closely resemble the Galactic disk.

We also show a representative sample of Galactic disk stars from \citet[open red square,][]{Bensby2014}, \citet[green circles][]{Battistini2016}. These elemental ratios give a representive example of the chemical composition of our sample and show they are consistent with the Galactic disk population. } %Mg was chosen as an illustrative $\alpha$-element. } 
\end{figure*}


We note that one of the stars (HD~175740) can also be found in the Hypatia catalogue \citep{hypatia}. The chemical abundance ratios in each element are consistent, within the uncertainties (of order $\sim$0.10--0.15~dex for most elemental abundance ratios in Hypatia and up to $\sim$0.05~dex here).

\subsubsection{Red Clump Stars}
\label{clumpstars}

Red clump stars, which burn helium in their cores, can be distinguished from hydrogen-shell burning giants asteroseismologically, via their much higher \emph{g}-mode period spacings \citep{rggmodehelium}. 
The term `red clump' arises from the fact that such stars can have a very narrow range of luminosities, so that they appear as a clump in the HR diagram \citep{2016ARA&A..54...95G}. This property makes them useful standard candles to which distances can be accurately computed from photometry. Red clump stars have been used to calibrate the \gaia survey's parallaxes at long distances \citep{2017A&A...598L...4D,2017MNRAS.471..722H,2018A&A...609A.116R}. \gaia~DR2 parallaxes have a zero-point offset of $\sim 0.03$~mas \citep{gaiadr2parallax}, and in particular hierarchical models of the ensemble of \gaia clump stars can be used to accurately estimate this and thereby improve the accuracy of \gaia distances greater than a few~kpc (Hawkins et al., in prep.).

From inspection of the power spectra, HD~181069, HD~183124, HD~182354, HD~182692, and HD~180658 are seen to be red clump stars. A power spectrum of the best example of these, HD~183124, together with an \'{e}chelle diagram used to estimate its \emph{g}-mode period spacing, is shown in Figure~\ref{HD_183124}. While precise characterization of these stars is beyond the scope of this paper, they are ideal candidates for anchoring models of the mass and metallicity dependence of red clump properties for calibrating \gaia and other distance measures.

\caption{\label{HD_183124}

The modes in the power spectrum used for the \'{e}chelle diagram are highlighted with blue dots. In the \'{e}chelle diagram we see the characteristic pattern of `bumped' modes from avoided crossings between the comb of \emph{p}-modes and \emph{g}-mode oscillations with a period spacing of $\Delta \Pi = 300.1~\text{s}$.}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Long Period Variables}
\label{lpvs}

\subsection{Main Sequence Stars}
\label{mainseq}

For all the main sequence stars in our sample, we inspected light curves and power spectra to determine their variability class. In the following subsections, we will briefly comment on some of the findings. Since main sequence variables are so diverse, and the relevant scientific questions so varied, we have attempted only a very preliminary study of these stars in this paper, leaving detailed analysis to future work.

Our sample includes pulsating stars of spectral type~B,~A, and~F, with their names, properties and variability class listed in Table~\ref{all_stars}. 

Among the hot-star sample are 5 $\delta$\,Sct stars, which show p-mode pulsation. These oscillation modes have particularly long lifetimes and stable frequencies, making them precise stellar clocks with periods of $\sim$2\,hr. These can be used to search for binarity and to obtain orbital parameters from photometry alone \citep{shibahashi&kurtz2012}. We used the phase-modulation method of \citet{murphyetal2014} to investigate whether any of these $\delta$\,Sct stars were binaries. Any phase modulation is converted into a light arrival-time delay, and if a star is a binary, the time delays of each mode should vary in unison. Nearly 350 PM binaries are known in the full \textit{Kepler} dataset \citep{murphyetal2018}.

In four of the five targets we found evidence for binarity, while in the fifth (HD\,185397) there was some time-delay variation but there was no agreement between different modes so it is not of binary origin. Of the others, HD\,175841 and HD\,177781 are likely very long-period binaries, with periods far exceeding the Kepler datasets of $\sim$1470\,d. HD\,181521 appears to be an eccentric binary with a period of at least 1000\,d, but there is only 1 maximum and 1 minimum in the time-delay curve (cf. \citep{murphy&shibahashi2015}), so a unique orbital solution was unobtainable. Finally, HD\,186255 is likely a binary with a period of $\sim$415\,d, but there is a slight aperiodicity in the time delays, likely caused by beating between pulsation modes that are not well-separated in the frequency. That, coupled with the fact that this star is on the failed Module 3 and is therefore missing data every 4th quarter (i.e. $\sim$93 of every 372.5\,d), makes the binary classification uncertain. If indeed this is a 415-d binary, the time delays are consistent with a companion of minimum mass $\sim$0.45\,M$_{\odot}$ in an orbit of moderate eccentricity ($\sim$0.15).

Several stars have a more complex classification than can be adequately noted in Table~\ref{all_stars}: HD~189684 is listed as an ellipsoidal variable, but also shows evidence for $\gamma$\,Dor variability. HD~185397 and HD~186255 are listed as $\gamma$\,Dor/$\delta$\,Sct hybrids, but may in fact simply be $\delta$\,Sct variables with nonlinear combination frequencies, and a detailed frequency analysis will be required to distinguish between these possibilities. HD~184788 shows a combination of two rotational modulation signals with base frequencies: 0.0885 and~$0.1966 c/d$. HD~184875 is a $\gamma$\,Dor but also shows evidence for an unknown contaminant. V554~Lyr and V2079~Cyg are both known $\alpha^2$\,CVn variables, which are chemically peculiar stars with strong magnetic fields that show rotational modulation. V2079~Cyg also shows a weak $\delta$\,Sct signal. The detection of rotational modulation in the chemically-peculiar HD~175132 suggests its reclassification as an $\alpha^2$\,CVn variable. 

There are two stars whose variability we classify as $\alpha^2$\,CVn  HD~176582 (B5V) and HD~179395 (B9), but which are not previously known to be chemically-peculiar. have very short periods (1.58~d and 1.83~d respectively) and phase stability throughout the \kepler observations. While HD~176582 is listed as an eruptive variable by \citet{2016ApJ...829...23D}, this appears to be a misclassification considering the full \kepler smear light curve. Both stars show periods shorter than the shortest `heartbeat' binaries with tidally-induced pulsations from \citet{2012ApJ...753...86T}. Moreover, the variability periods are short enough that for a binary origin we would expect orbits to be circularized \citep{2000A&A...354..881D}. We suggest that it is likely that these are nevertheless $\alpha^2$\,CVn variables, and that it will be valuable to study these stars spectroscopically for signs of chemical peculiarity.

The coherent g-mode pulsations in samples of B, A, and F stars observed by \kepler previously showed these stars to be near-rigid rotators \citep{kurtz2014,saio15,triana15,vanreeth15,vanreeth16,vanreeth18,murphy16,schmid16,moravveji16,ouazzani17,papics17,aerts17,szewczuk18,2018arXiv180907779A}. These studies cover about 70 stars so far. However, the vast majority of intermediate-mass stars observed by Kepler have yet to be subjected to in-depth asteroseismic analyses and modelling of their interior properties. One of the valuable outputs of our current work includes the reduced light curves of several early-B stars, which were only scarcely targeted in the nominal \kepler mission. The few that were monitored did not reveal suitable oscillation frequency patterns to achieve a unique mode identification, which is a requirement to perform asteroseismic modelling. The investigation of pulsation modes in high-mass stars using high-quality \kepler smear data combined with high-precision spectroscopy to identify the modes \citep[Chapter 6]{aertsbook} is an exciting prospect for asteroseismology, as the interior physics of these stars are largely unknown, yet they play a pivotal role in stellar and galactic evolution. The in-depth asteroseismic analysis of the smear data for the~B~stars in this work is beyond the scope of the current paper, as it requires additional ground-based follow-up spectroscopy. Such studies will be the subject of future work.

\subsubsection{Hump and Spike Stars}
\label{hs}

Several stars in the sample show the `hump-and-spike' morphology in their power spectra (a broad `hump' of low-amplitude oscillations dominated by one high amplitude coherent oscillation toward the high frequency end of this band): HD~186155 (HR~7495), 14~Cyg (HD~185872, HR~7483), HD~189178 (HR~7628), HD~183362 (HR~7403), and HD~184787. Of these, HD~186155 and 14~Cyg are the third-- and sixth--brightest stars on silicon, making these the brightest stars that show this effect. The identification for HD~189178 is tentative, as the spectrum also shows evidence of SPB pulsations, and for HD~183362 for $\gamma$\,Dor pulsations, while for HD~184787 there is long term variability consistent with contamination. The other hump-and-spike identifications seem secure. \citet{2018MNRAS.474.2774S} have recently interpreted the hump-and-spike power spectra as evidence for Rossby modes. The F5 star HD~186155, identified by SIMBAD as having a giant spectral type of F5II-III, is shown by its \gaia distance to in fact lie on the main sequence. A detailed study of these stars will be presented by Antoci et al., in prep.

Another star with a hump-and-spike spectrum is Boyajian's~Star (KIC~8462852), which shows deep enigmatic dips in brightness \citep{2016MNRAS.457.3988B}, and has faded both throughout the \kepler mission \citep{2016ApJ...830L..39M} and in relation to Harvard photographic plates from 1890 onwards \citep{2016ApJ...822L..34S}. The dimming, which is chromatic in the manner expected of heterogeneous clouds of circumstellar dust in the line of sight \citep{2018ApJ...853..130D,2018arXiv180608842B}, has been ascribed to various causes \citep[reviewed in][]{2018RNAAS...2a..16W}, most notably a cloud of exocomets surrounding the star \citep[e.g.][]{2018MNRAS.473.5286W}. It is unclear whether the explanation of the hump-and-spike phenomenon will shed light on the strange behaviour of Boyajian's~Star, but it may be relevant.

\subsubsection{Binaries}
\label{ebs}

We detect BD+47~2825 as a new eclipsing binary system, and recover light curves for the previously-known eclipsing binaries HD~186994, V2083~Cyg, and V380~Cyg. The known binary system HD~189684 is newly identified as showing ellipsoidal variability, but does not show evidence of eclipses. We do not attempt detailed analysis of their variability in this paper.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

The \kepler Smear Campaign establishes a legacy sample of~102 very bright stars, with \kepler light curves that in almost all cases reveal astrophysically interesting variability. The virtue of these bright stars is that they can be studied with interferometry, and more easily with spectroscopy than fainter targets, permitting especially detailed characterization. We have therefore obtained detailed abundances of a subset of the red giants in this sample, particularly with a view to determining their provenance in the Galactic thick and thin disk populations. The science that can be done both with this sample and with this method are, however, considerably broader: while we have not attempted it in this paper, a compelling next step is to use interferometric diameter measurements and to further constrain the red giant parameters, and compare these to the constraints from \gaia. Any tension between these measurements will help test and refine the asteroseismic scaling relations, and better models will propagate through to smaller systematic uncertainties in large samples of stars too faint for interferometry. Further improvements will be revealed by the detailed modelling of individual oscillation frequencies in these giants to infer interior structure such as convective overshoot, which is at the time of writing an active topic of research. For the lower-frequency M~giants classed as LPVs in this paper, extending the systematics correction and quarter-stitching algorithms to more robustly correct their light curves without removing real signal will allow similar asteroseismic analysis, for a sample of stars that are much less well understood than their higher-frequency counterparts. 

The \kepler Smear Campaign has another natural extension: while many saturated stars in \ktwo have now been observed with `halo' apertures including their unsaturated pixels, many were not, either because they were fainter than the typical $Kp \lesssim 6.5$ limit, or because in Campaigns~0-3 and~5 no such apertures were selected. There is therefore the potential for a \ktwo Smear Campaign to complete the \ktwo sample down to fainter magnitudes, complementing the very brightest stars studied with halo photometry.

%\section{Full Chemical Analysis}
%The chemical composition for each star was measured in the $\alpha$ (Mg, Ti, Si, Ca), odd-Z (Al, Cu, Sc, V), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, Cr, Mn), and neutron capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) elemental families. In Fig.~\ref{fig:alphael}, we show the chemical abundance pattern of [Mg/Fe] as a function of metallicity of our sample (in black) as well two representative Galactic disk samples. It is clear from that figure that our sample is largely drawn from the Galactic disk from a chemical perspective. Below we provide further evidence of this with other elements across three families. 
%
%In Fig.~\ref{fig:alphael_appendix}, we display the abundances of the remaining $\alpha$-elements (including Ti, Si, Ca) as well as the odd-Z elements (Al, Cu, Sc, V). In Fig.~\ref{fig:Fepeak_appendix} we show the Fe-peak elements (Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, Cr, Mn) and in Fig.~\ref{fig:ncapture_appendix}  we show the Neutron-Capture elements. In each diagram we plot the [X/Fe] abundance ration as a function of metallicity. For reference, the typical chemical abundances pattern in the Galactic disk is shown for each element and are taken from Bensby2014, Adibekyan2012,
